# kit

Kit is the developer's toolkit here at CrowBoat! Over the course of our projects, we'll more likely than not find some code that would be useful to have everywhere and be readily available for re-use.

Do you have a package you think we should include? Open a package request issue, fill out the template, and connect it to a PR with your proposed golang package.

The package should keep third-party dependencies to a minimum as well as be tested for efficiency and correctness.
